# vscode-gitmate
This project is a Windows application that leverages the C++ programming language and the PowerShell scripting language to automate the process of synchronizing a local git repository with a remote one using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. The application takes a repository URL as an input argument and clones the repository to a specified local directory using the git clone command. It then creates a desktop shortcut that opens the cloned repository in VS Code using the code command. The application also registers event handlers for the open and close events of the VS Code shortcut, which execute the git pull and git commit -a -m “Auto-sync” && git push commands respectively. These commands ensure that the local repository is always updated with the latest changes from the remote repository before opening VS Code, and that any changes made locally are automatically committed and pushed to the remote repository after closing VS Code. This way, the application eliminates the need for manual git operations and ensures that the local and remote repositories are always in sync. Requirements: The application requires the following software to be installed on the system:

Git: A distributed version control system that manages the local and remote repositories. The application uses the git command-line tool to perform git operations. The latest version of Git can be downloaded from [this link].
VS Code: A lightweight and powerful code editor that supports multiple programming languages and extensions. The application uses the code command-line tool to open the cloned repository in VS Code. The latest version of VS Code can be downloaded from [this link].
